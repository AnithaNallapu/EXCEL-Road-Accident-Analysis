# Road Accident Analysis Project

## Objective
Conducted an independent analysis of UK road accident data to uncover patterns and insights related to accident frequency and severity.

## Project Breakdown

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Power Query for Data Cleaning:** Utilised Power Query in Excel to clean and transform the data, handling missing values, duplicates, and data standardisation.

### 2. Data Analysis and Visualisation
- **Sheets Created:**
  - **KPIs:** Defined and calculated key performance indicators for monitoring accident metrics.
  - **Monthly Trend:** Analysed accident trends over time with a focus on monthly variations.
  - **Road Type Analysis:** Visualised accident distribution across different road types.
  - **Treemap:** Created a treemap to represent various categories and their relative accident frequencies.
  - **Donut Charts:** Developed donut charts to visualise accident data by area type and light conditions.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Integrated all the visual elements into a comprehensive dashboard. Employed filter panels to allow interactive data exploration based on different criteria.

### 3. Key Insights
- **Trend Identification:** Observed and analysed trends in accident data over time, identifying critical periods and conditions.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Investigated correlations between various factors such as road type, light conditions, and accident severity.
- **High-Risk Areas:** Identified high-risk areas and conditions that contribute to a higher incidence of accidents.

## Skills Developed
- **Data Analysis:** Enhanced skills in data cleaning, processing, and analysing large datasets using Power Query and Excel.
- **Excel Proficiency:** Advanced usage of Excel functions, Power Query, and various data visualisation techniques.
- **Analytical Thinking:** Improved ability to identify trends, patterns, and correlations from complex datasets.
- **Self-Learning:** Demonstrated initiative in independently managing and executing the project.

## Project Workflow
- **Requirement Gathering:** Established the scope and objectives for the analysis.
- **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Cleaned and processed the dataset using Power Query.
- **Analysis & Visualisation:** Conducted detailed analysis and created various visual representations.
- **Dashboard Development:** Designed and built a full dashboard, enabling interactive analysis through filters.

## Conclusion
This project provided a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to road accidents and highlighted the importance of data analysis in identifying potential safety improvements.
